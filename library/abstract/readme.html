    secom has four abstract classes for communicating over a serial device:
    <dl>
      <dt>Device
      <dd>Represents a serial device. Used for reading from and writing to a serial
      device. Both Posix and Windows have a concrete version called COM_DEVICE.
      <dt>Settings
      <dd>Device communication properties such as baud rate and parity
      <dt>Timeouts
      <dd>Device properties that define if and when a read will time out
      <dt>Constants
      <dd>Use these constants to alter device properties. Both Posix and Windows have
      a concrete version called COM_CONTROL_CONSTANTS
    </dl>
